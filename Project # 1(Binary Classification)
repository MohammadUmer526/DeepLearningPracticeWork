# Step 1. Description of the Dataset
The dataset we will use in this tutorial is the Sonar dataset.

This is a dataset that describes sonar chirp returns bouncing off different services. The 60 input variables are the strength of the returns at different angles. It is a binary classification problem that requires a model to differentiate rocks from metal cylinders.
# Step 2. Baseline Neural Network Model Performance

** We will start off by importing all of the classes and functions we will need **

Now we can *load the dataset* using **pandas** and split the columns into 60 input variables (X) and 1 output variable (Y).

# Step 3. Re-Run The Baseline Model With Data Preparation

It is a good practice to prepare your data before modeling.

Neural network models are especially suitable to having consistent input values, both in scale and distribution.
We can achieve this in *scikit-learn* using a **Pipeline:**
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html 

Running this example provides the results below. We do see a small but very nice lift in the mean accuracy.

# Step 4. Tuning Layers and Number of Neurons in The Model
